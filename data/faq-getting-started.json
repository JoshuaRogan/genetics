	{
		"question": "What is a genotype?",
		"answer": "For diploid organisms including humans, individuals carry two copies of their genome. One copy is inherited from the sperm and one from the egg. A genotype describes the set of two alleles an individual has at one DNA region. In this simulator, the three possible genotypes are \"A₁A₁\", \"A₁A₂\", and \"A₂A₂\". The frequencies of each of the three genotype groups sum to 1."
	},
	{
		"question": "What is a generation and how is it modeled in this simulator?",
		"answer": "A generation refers to the descent from parents to offspring. In this simulator, mating occurs at one time period in a generation. This process makes each generation distinct and non-overlapping. Alleles of the next generation are derived solely from the immediately previous generation.</br></br>The alleles of a new generation are sampled from the previous generation without regard to which alleles have already been sampled and without regard to more ancestral generations."
	},
	{
		"question": "Can more than two alleles be modeled at a time?",
		"answer": "No. This simulator is designed for a two-allele system. In practice, multi-allele systems could be modeled by defining the \"A₁\" allele as the allele of interest, and defining the \"A₂\" allele as the collection of all non-A alleles combined."
	},
	{
		"question": "What is the population size?",
		"answer": "The population size used in the simulator is normally the counted number of individuals in the population. The number of alleles is twice the population size because each individual has two copies of each allele.</br></br>Advanced: For sexually reproducing organisms with unequal sex ratios, the effective population size should be input, rather than the counted number of individuals. The effective population size is calculated as follows:</br></br><code>Nₑ = (4Nₘ x N<sub>f</sub>) / (4ₘ + N<sub>f</sub>)</code></br></br>Where Nₑ is the effective population size, and N<sub>m</sub> and N<sub>f</sub> are the number of males and females, respectively."

		"question": "What happens if Hardy-Weinberg assumptions are violated?",
		"answer": "Answering this question is the main purpose of Population Genetics Explorer. Violations in Hardy-Weinberg assumptions may lead to interesting changes in the genetic composition of a population. </br></br> Many of the parameters set by the user represent forces that shape the genetic composition of the population. These forces are violations of the Hardy-Weinberg assumptions. Some have predictable effects on allele and genotype frequencies. Others represent random processes governed by chance. Combinations of forces can act at the same time."
	},
	{
		"question": "What is genetic drift?",
		"answer": "Genetic drift refers to the random changes in allele frequency that occur in any populations that are not infinite due to gametes being chosen at random. The number of a particular allele chosen may be different than its proportion in the population due to chance. Drift is particularly important for small populations."
	},
	{
		"question": "How is genetic drift modeled in this simulator?",
		"answer": "Genetic drift is modeled by the random selection of alleles from a current generation chosen to be transmitted to the next generation. This is achieved by random sampling with replacement.</br></br>For example, imagine that there are 10 alleles in a population, 5 A₁ and 5 A₂. One allele is selected at random, and then put back into the pool (making it  5 A₁ and 5 A₂ again) for the next selection of an allele. Drift occurs in any population that is not infinite."
	},
	{
		"question": "What is a population bottleneck?",
		"answer": "A population bottleneck occurs when the size of a population decreases for a number of generations, followed by an expansion. In this simulation, the population returns to its original size after the bottleneck."
	},
	{
		"question": "How is a population bottleneck modeled in this simulator?",
		"answer": "A population bottleneck is modeled by changing the size of the simulated population for a specified number of generations.</br></br>Note: While “bottleneck” generally refers to a temporary decrease in population size, the simulator allows any one-time change in size (i.e., decrease or increase) that lasts for any number of generations."
	},
	{
		"question": "What is an \"infinitely large\" population?",
		"answer": "An infinitely large population is a theoretical population comprising an infinite number of individuals. This allows chance events (such as the random sampling of alleles) to converge in probability toward the expected value and allele frequencies of the next generation are derived precisely from the previous generation. In other words, this assumption eliminates the role of chance.</br></br>It can be useful to use infinite population sizes to examine evolutionary forces other than genetic drift because infinitely-large populations do not experience the effects of genetic drift."
	},
	{
		"question": "How is an infinitely-large population modeled in this simulator?",
		"answer": "Because there is no random sampling of alleles in infinitely-large populations, allele frequencies of the next generation can be derived precisely from those of the previous generation.</br></br>The default setting of the simulator is to model the theoretical infinitely-large population.</br></br>A large finite population closely approximates the behavior of an infinitely-large population. Because the computational burden of simulating an infinitely-large population is considerably less than that of simulating a large finite population, users may desire to simulate infinitely-large populations rather than large finite populations."
