### Description


A population genetics simulator that allows students to explore the effects and interactions of several evolutionary forces.

The simulator allows users to change the allele frequencies of the population, the population size, and the number of generations. The simulator also allows users to change the fitness of the alleles, the migration rate, and the mutation rate. The simulator will then display the changes in allele frequencies over time in a graph.

### Features

- Allele vs. Generation Graphing
- Variables to modify the allele frequency:
  - Population size
	- Number generations 
	- Selection variables
	- Mutation
	- Migration
	- Assortative mating
	- Population bottleneck 
- Allele frequency table & graph
- Light / Dark themes
- Accessibility features such as keyboard navigation and screen reader support
